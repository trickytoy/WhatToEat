# Project Title

As a gym addict, eating is extremely important to build muscle, lose fat and overall improve your health. However cooking as a university student cooking is exhausting and hard, especially when your cooking knowledge is very VERY limited. This project will hopefully help users find recipes that are more suited for their needs!




## GPT

The project utilizes a GPT model that I created in order to better fit the requirements of the project. The GPT API is then used to recommend recipes.
